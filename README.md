# c-tnn
C Toy Neural Network, based off of readings from `Math for Deep Learning,` self-implementation of neural nets with backpropagation. 

Goals: 
- Implement .csv reading and matrix multiplication
- Implement neural networks alongside (1) convolutional layers (2) pooling layers
- Test classication on (1) Iris dataset and (2) MNIST digits
- Implement backpropagation /w SGD and ADAM.
- Optimize with SIMD and Apple Metal (long-term)
